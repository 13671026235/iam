  extending the [MitreID connect server][mitre] functionality
- [SCIM][scim] user and group provisioning and management
- A partial implementation of the [OAuth Token Exchange draft
  standard][token-exchange] for OAuth token delegation and impersonation

The IAM is currently released as a [Docker image][iam-image] hosted on
Dockerhub.

Documentation on how to build and run the service can be found in the [IAM
GitBook manual][gitbook-manual] or on [Github][github-doc].
